# Configuration guide

This template requires two levels of configuration 

- parameters for template execution
- parameters to set after the content has been generated - there are several reasons for these - limitations of current .net CLI and its ability to parse/process complex values, their business value (they are likely not known at the initial stages of the project) and also their overall number (and the absence of defaults) would make th
items to configure

Template recognizes two required params

- APIName - name of the API e.g. Fraud.API
- APIPortNumber - port number e.g. 15000

The other (post generation) attributes are

- swagger version (see Startup.cs in the API project)
- version prefix in swagger endpoint (also in Startup.cs)
- port in service manifest (see ServiceManifest.xml in API project)
- AppInsights instrumentation key for the app and the internal one for BigBrother (see appsettings json file corresponding to the target environment (e.g appsettings.Production.json) -see "TBA" values
 - STS configuration - see appsettings json corresponding to the environment - see ServiceConfigurationOptions node and values of "TBA"
